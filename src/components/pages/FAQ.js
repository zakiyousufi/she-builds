        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 text-sky-500">Who are we?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Society of Afghan Women Engineers is a nonprofit organization that is not linked to any political group. The aim of this organization is to improve the capacity of women engineers who have been prevented from continuing their education or work due to imposed government restrictions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Society of Afghan Women Engineers is formed by bringing together professors, employees of various institutions, and engineering graduates with the cooperation of national and international organizations to work together to improve the necessary capacities and skills of girls who have been kept away from work and education in engineering by holding seminars, workshops, and free training courses.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 text-sky-500">Who are the audiences of this Organization?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The target includes all relevant individuals in the engineering community, including girls and women who have been left out of work and education due to restrictions inside Afghanistan and want to learn more skills and knowledge in the engineering field. Employees of different departments and specialists in all engineering departments who want to share their knowledge and skills in this large engineering network. As well as graduates of the engineering field who are looking for opportunities to work or study abroad.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Society of Afghan Women Engineers is looking to establish a large engineering network to assist anyone who is seeking engineering knowledge improvement, career workshops, and job consultation in engineering fields.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 text-sky-500">Performing Method</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We intend to hold various training courses in cooperation with experienced professors inside Afghanistan and partner engineers abroad to increase the learning and strengthen the skills of the members of this organization. We are also trying to make this process more inclusive and useful by signing a memorandum of understanding with educational institutions that promote the capacity of Afghan women and girls.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 text-sky-500">Necessity of Creating This Organization</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          After the change in the system in the Afghanistan government, women and girls were completely deprived of learning and working in the engineering field. Today, a large number of talented girls who were studying in this field and countless women who played a fruitful role in various projects in the engineering sector sit in complete destitution, and if this process continues for longer, all their multi-year efforts and knowledge in education will be forgotten and become useless.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Since it is only possible to come together and accept each other, a suitable solution for knowledge sharing and capacity building and skills has been found, and the organization is created. As much as, 150 girls from different parts of the country have responded positively to the establishment of this organization. Most of these girls have been students or graduates and are looking for ways to increase their knowledge and skills.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This is feedback from a female engineer, by the name of Ariana, from Mazar-E-Sharif:
        </p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 pl-4 italic mb-4">
          "First of all, I thank those involved in this program. Promoting modern knowledge, along with strong faith and arming girls and women who count half of the society is the only way to save human society. Indeed, creating such an organization will help women and girls who are deprived of education and work emotionally, psychologically, and financially. Wishing you successes."
        </blockquote>
        <p className="mb-4">
          By receiving such positive messages, we decided to create an organization for female engineers to take a positive step towards achieving their goals.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The mission of the Society of Afghan Women Engineers is to empower and inspire Afghan women in the field of engineering. We are committed to fostering a supportive community that encourages education, professional development, and leadership opportunities. Our goal is to break down barriers, promote diversity, and contribute to the advancement of engineering in Afghanistan by harnessing the talents and potentials of Afghan women.
